Donâ€™t rely on any one thing to keep us secure, but instead build layers of checks and controls:
* proprietary Google-designed hardware
* Google-controlled firmware
* Google-curated OS images
* a Google-hardened hypervisor
* data center physical security and services

We provide assurances in these security layers through roots of trust, such as Titan Chips for Google host machines and Shielded Virtual Machines
